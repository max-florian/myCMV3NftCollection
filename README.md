# Max's Collection

Welcome to **Max's Collection**, my very own Candy Machine V3 NFT Collection.

## Project Overview

This project uses the [Metaplex Candy Machine](https://docs.metaplex.com/) to manage the minting process of NFTs. The assets for the collection are sourced from the [Metaplex Example Candy Machine Assets](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/example-candy-machine-assets/tree/main/assets), and the front-end template is adapted from [cherrynoize's repository](https://github.com/cherrynoize/).
